\bi

  \item Consider the mathematical expression 

  \bi

    \item[] $(x + 2) * (2 * x + 1) + 3 * x$

  \ei

  where $x$ denotes a natural number.

\pause

  \item This expression $e$ has two values:

  \be

\pause

    \item A \bblue{semantic value} that is
      the natural number denoted by $e$.

\pause

    \item A \bblue{syntactic value} that is the expression $e$ itself
      having the form of a polynomial (which we denote by the
      quotation $\bluesynbrack{e}$).

  \ee

\pause

  \item Some operations apply to semantic values.

    \item \bbrown{Examples}: \bgreen{$+$} and \bgreen{$*$}.

\frametitle{Syntax-Based Mathematical Algorithms}

  \item A \bblue{syntax-based mathematical algorithm (SBMA)}
    \bbrown{[Far13]} is an transformer that manipulates the syntax of
    mathematical expressions in a mathematically meaningful way.

  \bi

    \item \bbrown{Examples}: normalize, factor, add.

  \item \bred{SBMAs are commonplace in mathematics!}

\pause

  \item A SBMA $A$ has two fundamental properties:

  \be

    \item The \bblue{computational behavior} of $A$ is the relationship
    between the input and output expressions of $A$.

    \item The \bblue{mathematical meaning} of $A$ is the relationship
      between what the input and output expressions of $A$ mean
      mathematically.

  \ee

  \item A \bblue{meaning formula} for $A$ is a statement that
    expresses the mathematical meaning of $A$.

  \item Let $L$ be a language in some underlying logic.

    $\Gamma$ is a set of formulas of $L$ that serve as the axioms of
    $T$.

    theory be combined so that we can define and reason about SBMAs in
    the same context?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Biform Theories}
\bi

  \item A \bblue{biform theory} is a triple $T=(L,\Pi,\Gamma)$ where:

  \be

    \item $L$ is a language of some underlying logic.

    \item $\Pi$ is a set of transformers that implement functions on
      the expressions of $L$.

    \item $\Gamma$ is a set of formulas of $L$ that serve as the axioms of $T$.

  \ee

  \item For each $\pi \in \Pi$, $L$ includes a name for the function
    implemented by $\pi$ that serves as a name for $\pi$.

  \item The axioms of $T$ specify the meaning of the nonlogical
    symbols of $L$ including the names of the transformers of $T$.

  \item The transformers may be written in $L$ or in a programming
    language external to $L$.

  \item $T$ is an axiomatic theory if $\Pi$ is empty and is an
    algorithmic theory if $\Gamma$ is empty.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Formalizing Biform Theories}
\bi

  \item To formalize a biform theory in a logic \textbf{Log} we need
    to be able to formalize SBMAs in \textbf{Log}.

\pause

  \item To formalize an SBMA $A$ in \textbf{Log} we must:

  \be

    \item Define or specify in \textbf{Log} a function $B$ on
      syntactic values representing $A$.

    \item State and prove in \textbf{Log} the meaning formula for
      $B$ from the definition or specification of $B$.

    \item Apply $B$ to mathematical expressions in \textbf{Log} by
      instantiating the meaning formula for $B$ and then applying the
      result.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Standard Approach: Local Reflection}
\bi

  \item Let $A$ be an SBMA on expressions in a language $L_{\rm obj}$
    of some logic \textbf{Log}.

  \item We build a \bblue{metareasoning infrastructure} in
    \textbf{Log} consisting of:

  \be

    \item An \bgreen{inductive type} $L_{\rm syn}$ of syntactic values
      representing the expressions in $L_{\rm obj}$.

    \item A \bgreen{quotation operator} $\bluesynbrack{\cdot}$ mapping
      expressions in $L_{\rm obj}$ to syntactic values of $L_{\rm
        syn}$.

    \item An \bgreen{evaluation operator} $\redsembrack{\cdot}$
      mapping syntactic values of $L_{\rm syn}$ to values of $L_{\rm
        obj}$.

  \ee

  \item We define a function $B$ in \textbf{Log} from syntactic values
    representing inputs of $A$ to syntactic values representing
    outputs of $A$.

  \item The infrastructure is \bgreen{local} in the sense that $L_{\rm
    obj}$ is not the whole language $L$ of Log.

\frametitle{An Alternate Approach: Global Reflection}
\bi

  \item Local reflection does not scale up well:

  \bi

    \item Each collection of SBMAs requires a separate infrastructure.

    \item Extending an SBMA to a new domain requires a new
      infrastructure.

  \ei

  \item Global reflection employs a single infrastructure for all
    SBMAs:

  \be

    \item An \bgreen{inductive type} representing the entire set of expressions.

    \item A \bgreen{global quotation operator} $\bluesynbrack{\cdot}$.

    \item A \bgreen{global evaluation operator} $\redsembrack{\cdot}$.

  \ee

  \item Global reflection requires a logic with global quotation and
    evaluation operators.

  \item \bred{It is an open problem whether global reflection is
    viable!}

\iffalse
  \item To test the viability of global reflection, we want to
    incorporate global quotation and evaluation into a traditional
    logic.

  \item \bblue{Primary objective}. Develop a methodology for expressing,
    manipulating, managing, and generating mathematical knowledge as a
    graph of biform theories.

  \item The project is a subproject of \bblue{MathScheme}, a long-term
    project to produce a framework for integrating \bgreen{formal deduction}
    and \bgreen{symbolic computation}.

  \item Our strategy is to break down the problem into five

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{1. Logic}
\bi

  \item \bblue{Objective}.  Design a logic \textbf{Log} that is a version of
    simple type theory with an inductive type of syntactic values, a
    global quotation operator, and a global evaluation operator.

\pause

  \item \bblue{Status}.  We have developed {\churchqe}
    \bbrown{[Far18]}, a version of Church's type theory with global
    quotation and evaluation operators.

  \bi

    \item {\churchqe} is suitable for defining SBMAs and stating,
      proving, and instantiating their meaning formulas.

    \item We have defined in {\churchqe} a notion of a theory morphism
      \bbrown{[Far17]}.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{2. Implementation}
\bi

  \item \bblue{Objective}.  Produce an implementation \textbf{Impl} of
    \textbf{Log} and demonstrate that SBMAs can be defined in
    \textbf{Impl} and their meaning formulas can be stated, proved,
    and instantiated in \textbf{Impl}.

\pause

  \item \bblue{Status}.  We have produced an implementation of
    {\churchqe}, called HOL Light QE \bbrown{[CarFarLas18]}, by
      modifying HOL Light.

  \bi

    \item We are working now on testing HOL Light QE by formalizing
      SBMAs in it.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{3. Transformers}

    defined outside of \textbf{Impl} to expressions of \textbf{Log}.

\frametitle{4. Theory Graphs}
\bi

  \item \bblue{Objective}. Enable biform theory graphs to be defined

    theory graph consisting of eight biform theories encoding natural
    number arithmetic \bbrown{[CarFar17]}.

      {\churchqe} and Agda.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{5. Generic, Specializable Transformers}

    scheme for defining generic transformers in a biform theory $T$
    that can be automatically specialized when transported to an
    instance of $T$ using code generation.

    generic programs of this form.

\frametitle{Conclusion}
The Biform Theories project seeks to show that:

  \be

    \item Global reflection is a viable approach for formalizing
      SBMAs in biform theories.

    \item Biform theories provide an effective mechanism for
      integrating formal deduction and symbolic computation.

    \item A biform theory graph is a structure well suited for
      formalizing large bodies of mathematical knowledge.
