Abstract

We are interested in algorithms that manipulate mathematical
expressions in mathematically meaningful ways. Expressions are
syntactic, but most logics do not allow one to discuss syntax.  CTTqe
is a version of Church's type theory that includes quotation and
evaluation operators that are similar to quote and eval in the Lisp
programming language.  Since the HOL logic is also a version of
Church's type theory, we decided to add quotation and evaluation to
HOL Light to demonstrate the implementability of CTTqe and the
benefits of having quotation and evaluation in a proof assistant.  The
resulting system is called HOL Light QE.  Here we document the design
of HOL Light QE and the challenges that needed to be overcome.
