\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

A \emph{syntax-based mathematical algorithm (SBMA)} manipulates
mathematical expressions in a mathematically meaningful way.  SBMAs
are commonplace in mathematics.  Examples include algorithms that
compute arithmetic operations by manipulating numerals, linear
transformations by manipulating matrices, and derivatives by
manipulating functional expressions.  Reasoning about the mathematical
meaning of an SBMA requires reasoning about the relationship between
how the expressions are manipulated by the SBMA and what the
manipulations mean mathematically.

We argue in~\cite{Farmer13} that the combination of quotation and
evaluation provides the means to reason about the interplay between
syntax and semantics that is needed for reasoning about SBMAs.
\emph{Quotation} is an operation that maps an expression $e$ to a
special value called a \emph{syntactic value} that represents the
syntax tree of $e$.  Quotation enables expressions to be manipulated
as syntactic entities.  \emph{Evaluation} is an operation that maps a
syntactic value $s$ to the value of the expression that is represented
by $s$.  Evaluation enables meta-level reasoning via syntactic values
to be reflected into object-level reasoning.  Quotation and evaluation
thus form an infrastructure for integrating meta-level and
object-level reasoning.

Incorporating quotation and evaluation operators --- like quote and
eval in the Lisp programming language --- into a traditional logic
like first-order logic or simple type theory is not a straightforward
task.  Several challenging design problems stand in the way.  The
three design problems that most concern us are the following.  We will
write the quotation and evaluation operators applied to an expression
$e$ as $\synbrack{e}$ and $\sembrack{e}$, respectively.

\be

  \item \emph{Evaluation Problem.}  An evaluation operator is
    applicable to syntactic values that represent formulas and thus is
    effectively a truth predicate.  Hence, by the proof of Alfred
    Tarski's theorem on the undefinability of truth~\cite{Tarski35a},
    if the evaluation operator is total in the context of a
    sufficiently strong theory like first-order Peano arithmetic, then
    it is possible to express the liar paradox using the quotation and
    evaluation operators.  Therefore, the evaluation operator must be
    partial and the law of disquotation cannot hold universally (i.e.,
    for some expressions $e$, $\sembrack{\synbrack{e}} \not= e$).  As
    a result, reasoning with evaluation is cumbersome and leads to
    undefined expressions.

  \item \emph{Variable Problem.}  The variable $x$ is not free in the
    expression $\synbrack{x + 3}$ (or in any quotation).  However, $x$
    is free in $\sembrack{\synbrack{x + 3}}$ because
    $\sembrack{\synbrack{x + 3}} = x + 3$.  If the value of a constant
    $c$ is $\synbrack{x + 3}$, then $x$ is free in $\sembrack{c}$
    because $\sembrack{c} = \sembrack{\synbrack{x + 3}} = x + 3$.
    Hence, in the presence of an evaluation operator, whether or not a
    variable is free in an expression may depend on the values of the
    expression's components.  As a consequence, the substitution of an
    expression for the free occurrences of a variable in another
    expression depends on the semantics (as well as the syntax) of the
    expressions involved and must be integrated with the proof system
    for the logic.  That is, a logic with quotation and evaluation
    requires a semantics-dependent form of substitution in which side
    conditions, like whether a variable is free in an expression, are
    proved within the proof system.  This is a major departure from
    traditional logic.

  \item \emph{Double Substitution Problem.}  By the semantics of
    evaluation, the value of $\sembrack{e}$ is the \emph{value} of the
    expression whose syntax tree is represented by the \emph{value} of
    $e$.  Hence the semantics of evaluation involves a double
    valuation.  If the value of a variable $x$ is $\synbrack{x}$, then
    $\sembrack{x} = \sembrack{\synbrack{x}} = x = \synbrack{x}$.
    Hence the substitution of $\synbrack{x}$ for $x$ in $\sembrack{x}$
    requires one substitution inside the argument of the evaluation
    operator and another substitution after the evaluation operator is
    eliminated.  This double substitution is another major departure
    from traditional logic.

\ee

{\churchqe}~\cite{FarmerArxiv16,Farmer16} is version of Church's type
theory~\cite{Church40} with quotation and evaluation that solves these
three design problems.  It is based on {\qzero}~\cite{Andrews02},
Peter Andrews' version of Church's type theory.  We believe
{\churchqe} is the first readily implementable version of simple type
theory that includes global quotation and evaluation operators.  We
show in~\cite{FarmerArxiv16} that it is suitable for defining,
applying, and reasoning about SBMAs.

To demonstrate that {\churchqe} is indeed implementable, we have
implemented {\churchqe} by modifying HOL Light~\cite{Harrison09}, a
simple implementation of the HOL logic~\cite{GordonMelham93}.  The
resulting version of HOL Light is called HOL Light QE.  This paper
presents the HOL Light QE implementation.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section~\ref{sec:ctt-qe} presents the key ideas underlying {\churchqe}
and explains how {\churchqe} solves the three design problems given
above.  Section~\ref{sec:hol-light} offers a brief overview of HOL
Light.  The HOL Light QE implementation is described in
section~\ref{sec:implementation}, and examples of how quotation and
evaluation are used in it are discussed in section~\ref{sec:examples}.
Section~\ref{sec:related-work} is devoted to related work.  And the
paper ends with some final remarks in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
including a brief discussion on future work.

\section{${\rm CTT}_{\rm qe}$}\label{sec:ctt-qe}

The syntax and semantics of {\churchqe} as well as the proof system
for {\churchqe} are defined in~\cite{FarmerArxiv16}.  In this section
we will only introduce the definitions and results of {\churchqe} that
are key to understanding how HOL Light QE implements {\churchqe}.  The
reader is encouraged to consult~\cite{FarmerArxiv16} when additional
details are required.

\subsection{Syntax}

The syntax of {\churchqe} has the same machinery as {\qzero} plus an
inductive type $\epsilon$ of syntactic values, a partial quotation
operator, and a typed evaluation operator.

A \emph{type} of {\churchqe} is defined inductively by the following
formation rules:
%
\be

  \item \emph{Type of individuals}: $\iota$ is a type.

  \item \emph{Type of truth values}: $\omicron$ is a type.

  \item \emph{Type of constructions}: $\epsilon$ is a type.

  \item \emph{Function type}: If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are types, then
    $(\alpha \tarrow \beta)$ is a type.

\ee

\noindent
Let $\sT$ denote the set of types of {\churchqe}.  

A \emph{typed symbol} is a symbol with a subscript from $\sT$.  Let
$\sV$ be a set of typed symbols such that, for each $\alpha \in \sT$,
$\sV$ contains denumerably many typed symbols with subscript~$\alpha$.
A \emph{variable of type $\alpha$} of {\churchqe} is a member of $\sV$
with subscript~$\alpha$.  $\textbf{x}_\alpha, \textbf{y}_\alpha,
\textbf{z}_\alpha, \ldots$ are syntactic variables ranging over
variables of type $\alpha$. Let $\sC$ be a set of typed symbols
disjoint from $\sV$.  A \emph{constant of type $\alpha$} of
{\churchqe} is a member of $\sC$ with subscript~$\alpha$.
$\textbf{c}_\alpha, \textbf{d}_\alpha, \ldots$ are syntactic variables
ranging over constants of type~$\alpha$.  $\sC$ contains a set of
\emph{logical constants} that include $\mname{app}_{\epsilon \tarrow
  \epsilon \tarrow \epsilon}$, $\mname{abs}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon
  \tarrow \epsilon}$, and $\mname{quo}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon}$.

An \emph{expression of type $\alpha$} of {\churchqe} is defined
inductively by the formation rules below.  $\textbf{A}_\alpha,
\textbf{B}_\alpha, \textbf{C}_\alpha, \ldots$ are syntactic variables
ranging over expressions of type $\alpha$.  An expression is
\emph{eval-free} if it is constructed using just the first five
formation rules.
%
\be

  \item \emph{Variable}: $\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is an expression of type
    $\alpha$.

  \item \emph{Constant}: $\textbf{c}_\alpha$ is an expression of type
    $\alpha$.

  \item \emph{Function application}: $(\textbf{F}_{\alpha \tarrow
    \beta} \, \textbf{A}_\alpha)$ is an expression of type $\beta$.

  \item \emph{Function abstraction}: $(\LambdaApp \textbf{x}_\alpha
    \mdot \textbf{B}_\beta)$ is an expression of type $\alpha \tarrow
    \beta$.

  \item \emph{Quotation}: $\synbrack{\textbf{A}_\alpha}$ is an
    expression of type $\epsilon$ if $\textbf{A}_\alpha$ is eval-free.

  \item \emph{Evaluation}: $\sembrack{\textbf{A}_\epsilon}_{{\bf
      B}_\beta}$ is an expression of type $\beta$.

\ee 

\noindent
The sole purpose of the second component $\textbf{B}_\beta$ in an
evaluation $\sembrack{\textbf{A}_\epsilon}_{{\bf B}_\beta}$ is to
establish the type of the evaluation; we will thus write
$\sembrack{\textbf{A}_\epsilon}_{{\bf B}_\beta}$ as
$\sembrack{\textbf{A}_\epsilon}_\beta$.

A \emph{construction} of {\churchqe} is an expression of type
$\epsilon$ defined inductively as follows:

\be

  \item $\synbrack{\textbf{x}_\alpha}$ is a construction.

  \item $\synbrack{\textbf{c}_\alpha}$ is a construction.

  \item If $\textbf{A}_\epsilon$ and $\textbf{B}_\epsilon$ are
    constructions, then $\mname{app}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon
      \tarrow \epsilon} \, \textbf{A}_\epsilon \,
    \textbf{B}_\epsilon$, $\mname{abs}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon
      \tarrow \epsilon} \, \textbf{A}_\epsilon \,
    \textbf{B}_\epsilon$, and $\mname{quo}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon}
    \, \textbf{A}_\epsilon$ are constructions.

\ee

\noindent
The set of constructions is thus an inductive type whose base elements
are quotations of variables and constants and whose constructors are
$\mname{app}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon \tarrow \epsilon}$,
$\mname{abs}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon \tarrow \epsilon}$, and
$\mname{quo}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon}$.  As we will see shortly,
constructions serve as syntactic values.

Let $\sE$ be the function mapping eval-free expressions to
constructions that is defined inductively as follows:

\be

  \item $\sE(\textbf{x}_\alpha) = \synbrack{\textbf{x}_\alpha}$.

  \item $\sE(\textbf{c}_\alpha) = \synbrack{\textbf{c}_\alpha}$.

  \item $\sE(\textbf{F}_{\alpha \tarrow \beta} \, \textbf{A}_\alpha) =
    \mname{app}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon \tarrow \epsilon} \,
    \sE(\textbf{F}_{\alpha \tarrow \beta}) \, \sE(\textbf{A}_\alpha)$.

  \item $\sE(\LambdaApp \textbf{x}_\alpha \mdot \textbf{B}_\beta) =
    \mname{abs}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon \tarrow \epsilon} \,
    \sE(\textbf{x}_\alpha) \, \sE(\textbf{B}_\beta)$.

  \item $\sE(\synbrack{\textbf{A}_\alpha}) = \mname{quo}_{\epsilon
    \tarrow \epsilon} \, \sE(\textbf{A}_\alpha)$.

\ee

\noindent
When $\textbf{A}_\alpha$ is eval-free, $\sE(\textbf{A}_\alpha)$ is the
unique construction that represents the syntax tree of
$\textbf{A}_\alpha$.  That is, $\sE(\textbf{A}_\alpha)$ is a syntactic
value that represents how $\textbf{A}_\alpha$ is syntactically
constructed.  For every eval-free expression, there is a construction
that represents its syntax tree, but not every construction represents
the syntax tree of an eval-free expression.  For example,
$\mname{app}_{\epsilon \tarrow \epsilon \tarrow \epsilon} \,
\synbrack{\textbf{x}_\alpha} \, \synbrack{\textbf{x}_\alpha}$
represents the syntax tree of $(\textbf{x}_\alpha \,
\textbf{x}_\alpha)$ which is not an expression of {\churchqe} since
the types are mismatched.  A construction is \emph{proper} if it is in
the range of $\sE$, i.e., it represents the syntax tree of an
eval-free expression.

\subsection{Semantics}

The semantics of {\churchqe} is based on Henkin-style general
models~\cite{Henkin50}.  An expression $\textbf{A}_\epsilon$ of type
$\epsilon$ denotes a construction, and when $\textbf{A}_\epsilon$ is a
construction, it denotes itself.  The semantics of the quotation and
evaluation operators are defined so that the following theorems hold:

\begin{thm}[Law of Quotation] \label{thm:sem-quotation}
$\synbrack{\textbf{A}_\alpha} = \sE(\textbf{A}_\alpha)$ is valid in
  {\churchqe}.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Law of Disquotation] \label{thm:sem-disquotation}
$\sembrack{\synbrack{\textbf{A}_\alpha}}_\alpha = \textbf{A}_\alpha$
  is valid in {\churchqe}.
\end{thm}

\subsection{Proof System}

The proof system for {\churchqe} consists of the axioms for {\qzero},
the single rule of inference for {\qzero}, and additional axioms that
extend the rules for beta-reduction, define the logical constants of
{\churchqe}, specify $\epsilon$ as an inductive type, and state the
properties of quotation and evaluation.  We prove
in~\cite{FarmerArxiv16} that this proof system is sound for all
formulas and complete for eval-free formulas.

Substitution is performed in the proof system for {\churchqe} using
the properties of beta-reduction as Andrews does in the proof system
for {\qzero}~\cite[p.~213]{Andrews02}.  The syntactic notion of ``a
variable is free in an expression'' is replaced in Andrews'
beta-reduction axioms by the semantic notion of ``a variable is
effective in an expression'' when the expression is not necessarily
eval-free, and beta-reduction axioms for quotation and evaluation are
added to Andrews' beta-reduction axioms.  ``$\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is
effective in $\textbf{B}_\beta$'' means the value of
$\textbf{B}_\beta$ depends on the value of $\textbf{x}_\alpha$.
Clearly, if $\textbf{B}_\beta$ is eval-free, ``$\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is
effective in $\textbf{B}_\beta$'' implies ``$\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is
free in $\textbf{B}_\beta$''.  However, ``$\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is
effective in ${B}_\beta$'' is a refinement of ``$\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is
free in $\textbf{B}_\beta$'' on eval-free expressions since
$\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is free in $\textbf{x}_\alpha =
\textbf{x}_\alpha$, but $\textbf{x}_\alpha$ is not effective in
$\textbf{x}_\alpha = \textbf{x}_\alpha$.

\subsection{Design Problems} 

{\churchqe} solves the three design problems given in
section~\ref{sec:introduction}.  The Evaluation Problem is completely
avoided by restricting the quotation operator to eval-free expressions
and thus making it impossible to express the liar paradox.  The
Variable Problem is overcome by modifying Andrews' beta-reduction
axioms as described above.  The Double Substitution Problem is eluded
by using a beta-reduction axiom for evaluations that excludes
beta-reductions that embody a double substitution.

\section{HOL Light}\label{sec:hol-light}

HOL Light~\cite{Harrison09} is an open-source software system
developed by John Harrison at the Intel Corporation that assists users
in proving mathematical conjectures in a version of Church's type
theory.  It is a simple implementation of the HOL proof
assistant~\cite{GordonMelham93} written in OCaml and hosted on GitHub
at \url{https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/}.  Although it is a
relatively small system, it has been used to formalize many kinds of
mathematics and to proof-check many proofs including the lion's share
of Tom Hale's proof of the Kepler conjecture~\cite{HalesEtAl17}.

HOL Light is very well suited to serve as a foundation on which to
build an implementation of {\churchqe}.  First, it is an open-source
system that can be freely modified as long as certain very minimal
conditions are satisfied.  Second, it is an implementation of a
version of simple type theory that is essentially {\qzero}, the
version of Church's type theory underlying {\churchqe}, plus
polymorphic type variables.  The type variables in the implemented
logic are not a hindrance; they actually facilitate the implementation
of {\churchqe}.  And third, HOL Light supports the definition of
inductive types so that $\epsilon$ can be straightforwardly defined.
