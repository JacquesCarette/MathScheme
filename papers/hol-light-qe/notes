This adding new rules of inference to {\HL} and modifying the {\HL}
    \texttt{INST} rule of inference that similtaneously substitutes
    terms $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ for the free variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ in
    a sequent.  This required altering substitution so that it works
    correctly in the presence of quotations and evaluations.

  The first stage is described in
subsections~\ref{subsec:var-and-con}--\ref{subsec:terms}; the second
in subsections~\ref{subsec:axioms} and \ref{subsec:substitution}; the
third in subsection~{subsec:machinery}; and the fourth in
section~\label{sec:examples}.
