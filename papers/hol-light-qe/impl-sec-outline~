Outline of the Implementation and Example sections                                                                                               
  1. The definition of the inductive types "type" and "epsilon".                                    
                                                                                                    
       Note: "type" is not in CTT_qe but is needed since the HOL logic has                              
         type variables                                                                             
                                                                                                    
       Note: "epsilon" is essentially the same as in CTT_qe                                             
                                                                                                    
  2. The modification the HOL Light kernel  

       a. Expands the class of terms to include quotations,
          quasiquotations, and evaluations.

            Note: quasiquotation is not an official part of CTT_qe

       b. Introduces new rules of inference to:

            i. Implement the B axioms for CTT_qe 

           ii. Implement properties of quasiquotation

  3. Modifications to parser

  4. Supporting machinery

       a. Function definitions

       b. Tactics

       c. Theorems

  5. Example: Induction schema

       a. Expression of the induction schema presented in CTT_qe paper

       b. Proof in HOL Light of the induction schema using the
          induction axiom
