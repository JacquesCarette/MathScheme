Other errors:
- It would be nice if the last 2 lines of p.5 would not be orphaned from
  the contents which is on p.6
- All of the code in Section 5 should be *left-aligned* and NOT centered.
  (there is 1 listing on p.9, 4 on p.10, 3 on p. 11, 2 on p.12
  and 2 on p.13.  Almost all are affected with this problem.
- in several places in section 5 (first occurence on p.10) where things
  like "{ V}" are badly typeset, with the V overlapping with the }.  The
  V should be centered between the { and }.  [4 on p.10, 2 on p.11, etc.
  there are also "f)" that are not well typeset on p.12.
- some of the baselines for the inline Agda is off -- see "Set_0" in
  the middle paragraph on p.11, BT_6 and BT_2 on p.12, the \lambda expression
  on p.12 and 'bplus' on p.12.
