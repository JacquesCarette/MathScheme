\frametitle{Differentiation}
\bi

  \item An important task of calculus is to find the derivative of a
    function.

  \item A function $f : \mathbb{R} \tarrow \mathbb{R}$ is
    \bblue{differentiable at $a$} if \[\lim_{h \tarrow 0} \frac{f(a +
      h) - f(a)}{h}\] exists.  If this limit exists, it is
    denoted by $f'(a)$ and is called the \bblue{derivative of $f$ at
      $a$}.  The function $f'$ is called the \bblue{derivative of
      $f$}.

  \item Computing the derivative of function from the definition of a
    derivative is generally very difficult.

\frametitle{Symbolic Differentiation}

  \item It is much easier to compute derivatives using an algorithm
    that repeatedly applies \bblue{symbolic differentiation rules}
    such as:

  \bi

    \item[] \vspace{1ex} $\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0$ where $c$ is a constant.

    \item[] \vspace{1ex} $\frac{d}{dx}(u + v) = \frac{d}{dx}(u) + \frac{d}{dx}(v)$.

    \item[] \vspace{1ex} $\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = 
    \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
              0 & \hspace{1ex} \mbox{if } n = 0\\
              n \cdot x^{n-1} & \hspace{1ex} \mbox{if } n > 0.  
           \end{array}
    \right.$

    \item[] \vspace{1ex} $\frac{d}{dx}(\mname{ln}(x)) = \frac{1}{x}$.

    \item[] \vspace{1ex} $\frac{d}{dx}(u(v)) = \frac{d}{dv}(u(v)) \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(v)$.

    not on functions.

\frametitle{Syntax-Based Mathematical Algorithms}
\bi

  \item A \bblue{syntax-based mathematical algorithm (SBMA)}
    manipulates the syntax of expressions in a mathematically
    meaningful way.

  \bi

    \item SBMAs are commonplace in mathematics.

    \item Symbolic differentiation algorithms are examples of SBMAs.

  \ei

\pause

  \item A SBMA has two fundamental properties:

  \be

    \item The \bblue{computational behavior} is the relationship
      between its input and output expressions.

    \item The \bblue{mathematical meaning} is the relationship between
      what its input and output expressions mean mathematically.

  \ee

  \item Explains symbolic differentiation in derivative calculators.

\frametitle{Specification of SBMAs}
\bi

  \item A correct implementation requires a correct specification.

  \item Interplay of syntax and semantics makes specification
    difficult.

  \item This is because:

  \be

    \item Manipulating syntax is complex.

    \item Difficult to disentangle the interplay of syntax
      and semantics.

    \item Benign syntactic manipulations generate undefined
      expressions.

  \item Let {\Lang} be the set of expressions built by the usual
    operators on $\mathbb{R}$.

  \item Let $\mname{diff} : {\Lang} \tarrow {\Lang}$ be the SBMA
    that repeatedly applies symbolic differentiation rules.

  \item The specification of \mname{diff} is: For all $e \in \Lang$,\\
    if $f = (\LambdaApp x : \RR \mdot e)$ is differentiable at $a$,
    then $f'(a)$ is \[(\LambdaApp x : \RR \mdot \mname{diff}(e))(a).\]

  \item Note: If $f$ is not differentiable at $a$, then $f'$ is not
    defined at $a$.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Rational Expressions and Rational Functions} 
\bi

  \item A \bblue{rational expression (in $x$ over $\QQ$)} is an
    expression that denotes a member of $\QQ(x)$, the field of
    fractions of polynomials in $x$.

  \item A \bblue{rational function (in $x$ over $\QQ$)} is an
    expression $(\funQ{r})$ where $r$ is a rational expression.

  \bi

    \item Denotes a function of type $\QQ \tarrow \QQ$.

  \ei

  \item Notice that  $x$ plays different roles here.

  \item It is useful to normalize rational expressions.

  \bi

    \item For example, $x - 2 + \frac{x+1}{x-1}$ normalizes to
      $\frac{x-3}{x-1}$

    \item But $x/x$ normalizes to 1 and\\ \hspace{3.2ex} $1/x - 1/x$ normalizes to 0.

  \ei

  \item It is also useful to normalize rational functions ... but how?

\ei
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Rational Function Normalization Problem} 
\bi

  \item Consider the rational function $f =
    \funQ{\frac{x^4-1}{x^2-1}}$.

  \item In computer algebra systems, $\frac{x^4-1}{x^2-1}$ is
    interpreted both as a rational expression and as a rational
    function.

  \item This leads to the following problem:

  \bi

    \item The value of $\frac{x^4-1}{x^2-1}$ for $x = 1$ is undefined.

    \item $\frac{x^4-1}{x^2-1}$ normalizes to $x^2 +1$.

    \item The value of $x^2 +1$ for $x = 1$ is 2.

    \item So $f$ is effectively normalized to $g = \funQ{x^2+1}$, but
      $f \not= g$.

  \ei

  \item \bred{Hence CASs do not correctly normalize rational functions!}

\ei
\end{frame}

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Specification of Rational Function Normalization}
\bi

  \item Let {\Lang} be the set of rational functions.

  \item A \bblue{quasinormal form} is a rational expression $p/q$ in
    which there are no common irreducible polynomials of degree $\ge
    2$.

  \item Let $\mname{norm} : {\Lang} \tarrow {\Lang}$ be the SBMA that
    normalizes a rational function $\funQ{r}$ by quasinormalizing $r$.

  \item The specification of $\mname{norm}$ is: For all $(\funQ{r}) \in
    \Lang$, 

  \be

    \item $\mname{norm}(\funQ{r}) = (\funQ{r'})$ where $r'$ is
      quasinormal and

    \item $(\funQ{r})$ and $\mname{norm}(\funQ{r})$ denote the same
      function.

  \ee

\ei

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Formal Specification of SBMAs}
\bi

  \item Consider the specification of \mname{diff}: For all $e \in
    \Lang$,\\ if $f = (\LambdaApp x : \RR \mdot
    \colorbox{brown!40}{$e$})$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f'(a)$
    is \[(\LambdaApp x : \RR \mdot
    \colorbox{brown!40}{$\mname{diff}(e)$})(a).\]

\pause

  \item This should be written: For all $e \in \Lang$,\\ if $f =
    (\LambdaApp x : \RR \mdot \colorbox{yellow!40}{$\sembrack{e}$})$
    is differentiable at $a$, then $f'(a)$ is \[(\LambdaApp x : \RR
    \mdot \colorbox{yellow!40}{$\sembrack{\mname{diff}(e)}$})(a)\]

  where $\sembrack{e}$ is the value of the expression denoted by $e$.

\pause

  \item To formally specify and apply SBMAs we need a
    \bblue{reflection infrastructure} with quotation
    $\synbrack{\cdot}$ and evaluation $\sembrack{\cdot}$ operators.

  \item The interplay of syntax and semantics inherent in SBMAs can

  \item The formal specification of SBMAs requires a reflection
    infrastructure with quotation and evaluation operators.

  \item {\churchqe} and {\churchuqe} have built-in global reflection
