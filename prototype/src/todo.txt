1. get computations going
  - needs a way to interpret 'trustable communication'
2. induce transformers from rules and axioms
3. redo typechecker to be more general
4. implement type constructors (like monads) in Small Algebra
5. more conservative extensions
6. get rid of need for 'lift'
7. get rid of BinOp, PBinOp [done]
8. do a proper 2-level pretty-printer (see Chiron)
9. revamp simplifier
10. finish mmt translation
11. merge type decl and func defn into a single structure (in bindings)
12. figure out how to deal with 'instantiations' (co-equalizers?)
